# Sensitive Detection of Site-wise Convergent Evolution in Large Protein Alignments with ConDor

### Marie MOREL, Frédéric LEMOINE and Olivier GASCUEL

Welcome to ConDor workflow repository ! 

In this repository you can find our ConDor workflow developed to detect convergent evolution in amino acid alignements without prior knowledge of phenotype. 
ConDor is available from a web service located at https://condor.pasteur.cloud/.

ConDor is adapted to the detection of evolutionary convergence at the resolution of a mutation, without prior knowledge of constraints and phenotype. To run ConDor you will need a fasta alignment containing outgroup sequences, the corresponding tree and a file with outgroup sequence names.  

The output of ConDor is a list of mutations detected as convergent as they occur more often than expected under neutral evolution.
